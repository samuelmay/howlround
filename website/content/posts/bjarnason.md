Baldur Bjarnason's writing has turned up a few times on Hacker New recently. I thought his post on the [Single Page App Morality Play](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/single-page-app-morality-play/) was excellent.

His [100 things every web developer should know](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/100-things-every-web-developer-should-know/) drew more criticism, and, well, it's a listicle.
