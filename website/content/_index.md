I currently work as a full-stack web developer in Sydney, Australia. If you're interested in what I have worked on, please check out the Projects section of this site, or look at my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/samuelmay) for examples of my code.

There's a couple of interesting things there - like raw assembly code for [a project](https://github.com/samuelmay/coyote1-sm) with the Propeller microcontroller, and some [statistical regression and interpolation algorithms](https://github.com/samuelmay/Functerpolate) implemented in Clojure. Unfortunately most of those GitHub projects are very old now - mostly from my undergraduate days when I had free time!
 
Here's a short summary of my career. You might prefer the [PDF copy](/documents/resume.pdf) of my resume.

### Developer at 1-Stop Connections

Some of the projects I have been working on include

- An internal web app in .NET 6 MVC for our finance team in modern asynchronous C#
- A new invoicing system with a .NET Core Web API backend and an Angular frontend. It's used internally as well as by some of our biggest customers
- Improvements to our CI/CD including introducing containerized deployments on AWS and rewriting Windows batch scripts in Powershell
- Maintenance and business logic changes for large and heavily used traditional ASP.NET web applications

### Developer at MemNet

This was a small company where I was one of only 2 developers. We maintained a single large ASP.NET application.
- We migrated from rented physical servers to virtual servers on Google Cloud Platform
- I migrated our source control from Subversion to Git
- I helped improve performance by optimising queries and schemas on Microsoft SQL Server and wrestling with the NHibernate ORM.
- I used Bootstrap and Vue to develop prototypes for future versions of the application

### Mobile developer at 1-Stop Connections

In my first stint at 1-Stop, I was on the team developing their original mobile app. I simultaneously worked on both the native Android app in Java, and the native iOS app in Objective-C.

### Intern at Alcatel-Lucent

The first job where I wrote code was at Alcatel-Lucent, where I wrote some Perl scripts that ran on Sun Solaris UNIX servers for a high-availability telecom product. That sounds very old-school doesn't it? This was actually in the late 2000's, not the 1990s like you might expect!

### University Projects

For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on a project where software guitar effects could be controlled by an accelerometer directly attatched to the guitar. The idea was you could wave the guitar around and have it modify the sound. It was great fun and it even kind of worked - though it was never very practical. The software interfaced with jackd on Linux and was written in Python and C++.

I also contributed a bit of Python telemetry code for the Sunswift solar car racing team. I was only tangentially involved because of some friends - who went ahead to do really well in the trans-Australian race, and got head-hunted by Tesla to be battery engineers. Good for them!

### Arch Linux Contribution

For a brief period while at university, I maintained the Clojure package for Arch Linux. At this time I had added it to the AUR as a community package, and it was not yet an official part of the distro. I thought any evidence of this would have disappeared, but my name is happliy still recorded in the list of contributors on the [PKGBUILD file](https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/blob/packages/clojure/trunk/PKGBUILD). I also had a patch accepted into the init scripts for Intel wireless configuration.
